Welcome to the **Golf Swing Analyzer** project! This innovative tool leverages advanced pose estimation models to analyze golf swings from video inputs. Our aim is to help golfers improve their technique by providing insightful feedback based on established golf theories and professional golfer statistics.

## Project Overview

The Golf Swing Analyzer processes a video of a golfer's swing and outputs three key images that highlight the main phases of the swing. Using a sophisticated pose estimation model, it identifies various angles and points in the golfer's posture and compares them with the ideal positions and movements prescribed in golf theory.

### Key Features

- **Pose Estimation**: Utilizes a state-of-the-art pose estimation model to accurately track the golfer's body positions throughout the swing.
- **Swing Phase Detection**: Automatically segments the golf swing into three main parts for detailed analysis.
- **Angle and Point Analysis**: Identifies critical angles and points in the golfer's swing and compares them to ideal standards.

### Technologies Used

- **MediaPipe**: This project uses the MediaPipe Pose Estimation model, a cutting-edge solution developed by Google for real-time, high-fidelity pose tracking. The model is capable of tracking 33 key points on the body, providing detailed and accurate data on body posture and movement. This technology is crucial for our analysis, allowing for precise measurement and evaluation of the golfer's swing against established golfing standards.
